# Defi Escrow: A Decentralized Marketplace for Invoice Financing

## Vision

My vision is to build an open, permissionless financial infrastructure that solves real-world problems for businesses. I believe that by tokenizing real-world assets like invoices, we can unlock billions in trapped working capital and create a more efficient, global, and transparent financial system, directly contributing to the goals of Finternet.

## The Problem: The Working Capital Gap

Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the global economy, but they constantly face a critical challenge: a lack of working capital. This is often caused by:

Locked Liquidity: Funds are trapped in unpaid invoices with net 30, 60, or 90-day payment terms.
Slow & Inefficient Processes: Traditional invoice financing (factoring) is slow, paper-heavy, and geographically limited.
High Fees & Barriers to Entry: Banks and traditional firms charge high fees and have strict requirements, excluding many smaller businesses.

## The Solution: A Tokenized Invoice Marketplace

Defi Escrow provides a decentralized protocol that allows businesses to tokenize their invoices as NFTs and sell them to investors seeking short-term, asset-backed yield.

Instant Liquidity: Businesses receive cash flow instantly instead of waiting for weeks or months.
Global Capital Access: Businesses can access a global pool of investors, not just local banks.
Reduced Costs & High Transparency: Smart contracts automate the entire process, reducing overhead and making every transaction verifiable on the Solana blockchain.

## Core Architecture (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) consists of two core on-chain programs:

1.  Invoice Tokenization Program: A program that allows verified businesses to mint a NFT representing a real-world invoice. The NFT's metadata will contain the hashed invoice details to ensure privacy and verifiability.
2.  Marketplace & Escrow Program: The core logic for listing, purchasing, and settling the tokenized invoices. When an investor purchases an invoice, the protocol uses an escrow mechanism to ensure the business receives the funds and the investor receives the Invoice NFT simultaneously and trustlessly.

### User Flow

1.  Business: Mints an Invoice NFT for a $10,000 invoice due in 60 days.
2.  Business: Lists the NFT for sale on the marketplace for $9,800.
3.  Investor: Discovers the listing and purchases the Invoice NFT for $9,800 USDC.
4.  Protocol: Instantly transfers the $9,800 USDC to the Business and the Invoice NFT to the Investor.
5.  Settlement: When the original invoice is paid, the funds are routed to the NFT holder (the Investor), who realizes a 2% profit(percentage could fluctuate).
